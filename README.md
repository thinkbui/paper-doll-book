# PaperDollBook

This is a Rails project is meant to allow you to create and manage virtual books of paper dolls where each page represents a character or set of characters along with layers for outfits and backgrounds/foregrounds to build a scene.  The first stage of this project is just to store and manage the data that can be downloaded as a JSON that can be inserted with other assets into a HTML/JS template for local viewing, but future stages may expand the features of the web app.  So far nothing is complete.

This was originally conceived as a way to get my friends' kids interested in web programming in JS, but has since turned into my own study of Rails.  This is very much a work in progress, so use at your own risk.

**NOTE:** Although this is built on a web framework, this is designed to be run locally and therefore doesn't have all protections against attacks, such as SQL and JS-injection, implemented.  They may be added later as this app becomes more complex.
